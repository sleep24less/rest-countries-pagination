REST countries app

Built an app using RESTcountries API with pagination

For this app I:
• Fetched the data from the endpoint and displayed it.
• Made the list sortable alphabetically by name (ascending, descending).
• Implemented a filter(s) that filters countries by region and by area.
• Implemented pagination even though the API didn't have a method for pagination included.
